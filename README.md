# 🧨 Megapot Demo App

Welcome to the official demo repo for [Megapot](https://megapot.win) — the permissionless onchain jackpot protocol running $1M+ prize pools for anyone to plug into. Use this repo as a foundation to:

- Add a $1M jackpot to your site and earn fees
- Instantly incentivize user actions (signups, deposits, etc.)
- Launch your own jackpot using your ERC-20 token on Base
- Embed Megapot into your app, wallet, or chat interface

## 🚀 What’s in This Repo

This repo is a **modular starter kit** designed for:
- **Developers building new apps** with jackpot incentives
- **Mini apps** for wallets, messaging apps, and Farcaster frames
- **First-party** Megapot deployments with real-time updates
- **Reusable** components powered by `@megapot/sdk` and `@megapot/ui`

You can use this codebase as a production template — it’s the same structure we use internally and will be updated as we evolve the Megapot frontend.

## 🛠 Integration Options

You can integrate Megapot in one of 3 ways:

### 1. Plug-and-play Jackpot
Embed a Megapot jackpot directly into your site and earn 10% of every ticket your users purchase — plus Megapoints for engagement.

### 2. Incentivize Any User Action
Offer low-cost, high-perceived-value actions like:

> “Sign up and deposit $10 for a shot at $1,000,000”  
> “Top 10 users this week enter a $1M draw”

### 3. Launch a Custom Jackpot in Your Token
We'll help deploy a Megapot contract using your ERC-20 token, reducing sell pressure and adding utility.
